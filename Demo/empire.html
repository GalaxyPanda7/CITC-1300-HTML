    <h2>Rise of the Empire</h2>
    <p>In the decades following, the empire rose into power slowly taking over the galaxy. Many jedi were hunted into
        extinction. Very few jedi survived by going into hiding. Eventually people across the galaxy band together to
        start a rebellion against the empire.In the decades following, the Empire rose into power, slowly tightening its
        grip on the galaxy. Under Emperor Palpatine’s rule, oppressive policies were implemented to control planets,
        industries, and populations. Entire worlds were subjugated, with some, like Kashyyyk, exploited for their
        resources and labor, while others, such as Alderaan, became centers of political resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Jedi were declared traitors to the Republic after the execution of Order 66, which turned their loyal clone
        troopers against them. Many Jedi were hunted into extinction by the Empire’s new enforcers, the fearsome
        Inquisitors, and Darth Vader himself. The surviving Jedi, like Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda, went into hiding,
        severing their connections to the Force to avoid detection. Some quietly worked to protect pockets of hope,
        while others lived in isolation, haunted by their failure to stop the Sith.
    </p>
    <p>
        As the galaxy fell into despair, resistance against the Empire began to emerge. A key moment came with the
        formation of the Rebel Alliance, led by prominent figures such as Mon Mothma, Bail Organa, and Garm Bel Iblis.
        These leaders unified scattered resistance cells into a coordinated effort to stand against the tyranny of the
        Empire. They were secretly supported by surviving Jedi, like Kanan Jarrus and Ahsoka Tano, who offered guidance
        to key individuals fighting for freedom. </p>
