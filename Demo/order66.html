    <h2>Order 66</h2>

    <p>
        <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Order_66">Order 66</a>, also known as Clone Protocol 66, Protocol 66,
        or simply "the Order," was one of top-secret contingency orders that identified all Jedi as traitors to the
        Galactic Republic and, therefore, subject to summary execution by the Grand Army of the Republic. The order was
        programmed into the Grand Army clone troopers through behavioral modification biochips implanted in their
        brains, making it almost impossible for the clones to disobey the command to turn against their Jedi Generals.
        The Kaminoan scientists who designed the clone troopers believed it was only to be used as a contingency
        protocol against renegade Jedi. In secret, Order 66 was the means by which the Sith intended to bring about the
        long-awaited fall of the Jedi Order. During the Clone Wars, the Sith agenda was progressing relatively unnoticed
        until a premature activation of Order 66 resulted in the death of General Tiplar at the hands of Tup, a
        defective clone whose malfunctioning chip caused him to betray his Jedi officer. The incident led ARC trooper
        Fives to conduct his own investigation into the matter, believing the incident to be a Separatist plot against
        the Republic. On the galactic capital Coruscant, however, he learned that the chips conditioned the clones to
        become hostile against the Jedi. Furthermore, he discovered to an extent Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine's
        involvement in the conspiracy and attempted to assassinate him. Fives told what he knew to his Jedi superior
        Anakin Skywalker, but before the clone could prove it, he was killed by clone shock troopers of the Coruscant
        Guard.

        The plan continued apace for the remainder of the war, although the Jedi High Council had grown increasingly
        wary of the Chancellor's motives. In 19 BBY, a group of Jedi Masters sought to arrest Palpatine upon learning
        his true identity as the Sith Lord Darth Sidious. When their efforts failed, Palpatine used the incident to
        frame the Jedi Order for treason and, as such, forcibly compelled clone army to execute their Jedi commanding
        officers in accordance with Order 66.Across the galaxy, thousands of Jedi were betrayed and killed by their own
        troops while the Chancellor's new apprentice, the Sith Lord Darth Vader, formerly Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker,
        led the 501st Legion in a direct assault on the Jedi Temple of Coruscant. With the exception of a few surviving
        Jedi, such as Grand Master Yoda, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, former Padawan Ahsoka Tano, Padawans Kanan Jarrus
        and Cal Kestis, and Jedi Knight Cere Junda, the Great Jedi Purge was largely accomplished through the initial
        activation of Order 66. Even after the initial onslaught, Order 66 still stood, and all Jedi, even people who
        might be Jedi, were to be killed on sight. Sidious would go on to consolidate his reign as Emperor of the
        Galactic Empire, ruling for decades until the prophecy of the Chosen One came to pass, marking the end of the
        Sith and the restoration of balance in the Force by 4 ABY.
