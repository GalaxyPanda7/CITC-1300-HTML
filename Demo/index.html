    <h2> Clone Wars</h2>

    <p><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars">The Clone Wars</a> (22–19 BBY) was a galaxy-spanning
        conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, which had seceded from the
        Republic. Also referred to as the Clone War, it was named after the clone troopers used by the Grand Army of the
        Republic against the Separatist Droid Army. Due to the high volume of battle droids deployed in the conflict,
        the war would also be known as the Droid War. Furthermore, the existence of the Confederacy granted the conflict
        yet another name, the Separatist War. With both clones and droids being fielded in enormous numbers by each
        respective side, they were the largest military forces in galactic history, and fighting between them swept
        through the galaxy for three, nearly four, years.

    </p>
    <p> During the war's third and final year, the Republic drove the Separatists into redoubts within the Outer Rim
        Territories, initiating a campaign termed the Outer Rim Sieges. In an effort to reverse the course of the war,
        Grievous launched a massive strike on Coruscant through the Deep Core. Much of the Confederate fleet was lost in
        the assault, along with Head of State Count Dooku. The Confederacy quickly lost its core leadership in quick
        succession, with Grievous subsequently falling in battle during the Battle of Utapau, and the Separatist Council
        being massacred on Mustafar. This, coupled with the issuing of Order 66 and the deactivation of the droid army,
        led to the total capitulation of the Confederacy and, with it, an end to the war.

    <h2>Rise of the Empire</h2>
    <p>In the decades following, the empire rose into power slowly taking over the galaxy. Many jedi were hunted into
        extinction. Very few jedi survived by going into hiding. Eventually people across the galaxy band together to
        start a rebellion against the empire.In the decades following, the Empire rose into power, slowly tightening its
        grip on the galaxy. Under Emperor Palpatine’s rule, oppressive policies were implemented to control planets,
        industries, and populations. Entire worlds were subjugated, with some, like Kashyyyk, exploited for their
        resources and labor, while others, such as Alderaan, became centers of political resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Jedi were declared traitors to the Republic after the execution of Order 66, which turned their loyal clone
        troopers against them. Many Jedi were hunted into extinction by the Empire’s new enforcers, the fearsome
        Inquisitors, and Darth Vader himself. The surviving Jedi, like Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda, went into hiding,
        severing their connections to the Force to avoid detection. Some quietly worked to protect pockets of hope,
        while others lived in isolation, haunted by their failure to stop the Sith.
    </p>
    <p>
        As the galaxy fell into despair, resistance against the Empire began to emerge. A key moment came with the
        formation of the Rebel Alliance, led by prominent figures such as Mon Mothma, Bail Organa, and Garm Bel Iblis.
        These leaders unified scattered resistance cells into a coordinated effort to stand against the tyranny of the
        Empire. They were secretly supported by surviving Jedi, like Kanan Jarrus and Ahsoka Tano, who offered guidance
        to key individuals fighting for freedom. </p>
