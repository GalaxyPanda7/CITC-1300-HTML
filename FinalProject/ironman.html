                    <h2>His Story</h2>

                    <p>Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark was a billionaire industrialist, a founding member of the Avengers,
                        and the former CEO of Stark Industries. A brash but brilliant inventor, Stark was self-described
                        as a genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist. With his great wealth and exceptional
                        technical knowledge, Stark was one of the world's most powerful men following the deaths of his
                        parents and enjoyed the playboy lifestyle for many years until he was kidnapped by the Ten Rings
                        in Afghanistan, while demonstrating a fleet of Jericho missiles. With his life on the line,
                        Stark created an armored suit which he used to escape his captors. Upon returning home, he
                        utilized several more armors to use against terrorists, as well as Obadiah Stane who turned
                        against Stark. Following his fight against Stane, Stark publicly revealed himself as Iron Man.
                    </p>

                    <p>Fresh off from defeating enemies all over the world, Stark found himself dying due to his own Arc
                        Reactor poisoning his body, all while he was challenged by Ivan Vanko who attempted to destroy
                        his legacy. After the Stark Expo incident, Stark reluctantly agreed to serve as a consultant for
                        S.H.I.E.L.D. where he used his position to upgrade their technology while he began a
                        relationship with Pepper Potts. With the world yet again being threatened, Stark joined the
                        Avengers and helped defeat the Chitauri and Loki. Due to the battle, he suffered from
                        post-traumatic stress disorder, leading him to create the Iron Legion to safeguard the world and
                        help him retire.</p>

                    <p>The 2013 "Mandarin" terrorist attacks forced Stark to come out of retirement to protect his
                        country, inadvertently putting his loved ones at risk and leaving him defenseless when his home
                        was destroyed. Stark continued his mission, finding Aldrich Killian as the mastermind of the
                        attacks. Eventually, Stark defeated Killian, and was prompted to destroy all of his armors with
                        the Clean Slate Protocol after almost losing Potts. However, when the Avengers were officially
                        demobilized due to the War on HYDRA, Stark built more armors and resumed his role as Iron Man,
                        aiding them in the capture of Baron Strucker and acquiring Loki's Scepter.</p>

                    <p>Once the threat of HYDRA had been ended, at last, Stark, influenced by Wanda Maximoff's visions,
                        built Ultron with the help of Bruce Banner as a new peacekeeping A.I. to protect the world and
                        allow the Avengers to retire. However, Ultron believed that humanity threatened the world and
                        thus, according to his program, decided to extinguish humanity. Through the work of the
                        Avengers, Ultron was defeated, however, not without massive civilian cost and many lives being
                        lost during which Sokovia was elevated into the sky.</p>

                    <p>After the Ultron Offensive, Stark retired from active duty, still haunted by his role in the
                        chaos the A.I. created. The guilt of creating Ultron and causing so much destruction and loss of
                        life eventually convinced Stark to support the Sokovia Accords. Stark was forced to lead a
                        manhunt for his ally Captain America when the latter began protecting the fugitive Winter
                        Soldier, igniting the Avengers Civil War. The result left the Avengers in complete disarray,
                        especially after Stark learned of Winter Soldier's role in his parents' deaths. Afterwards,
                        Stark returned to New York to mentor and guide Spider-Man into becoming a better hero than he
                        ever was, also becoming engaged with Potts in the process.</p>

                    <p>In 2018, when Thanos and the Black Order invaded Earth in their conquest to acquire the six
                        Infinity Stones, Stark, Doctor Strange, and Spider-Man convened to battle Thanos on Titan with
                        the help of the Guardians of the Galaxy. When Stark was held at Thanos' mercy, Doctor Strange
                        surrendered the Time Stone for Stark's life. After the Snap, Stark and Nebula remained the sole
                        survivors on Titan. Stark and Nebula used the Benatar to escape Titan, but were stranded in
                        space as the ship was damaged. They were rescued by Captain Marvel, who brought them back to
                        Earth.</p>

                    <p>In the five years after the Snap, Stark chose to retire from being Iron Man, marrying Potts and
                        having a daughter, Morgan. When Stark devised a method to safely travel through time and space,
                        he rejoined the Avengers in their mission to acquire the six Infinity Stones from the past in
                        order to resurrect those killed by the Snap, and traveled back in time to retrieve the Scepter
                        and regain the Tesseract. During the Battle of Earth, Stark sacrificed himself to eliminate an
                        alternate version of Thanos and his army, who traveled through time to collect their Infinity
                        Stones, saving the universe from decimation and leaving behind a legacy as one of Earth's most
                        revered superheroes.</p>
