                    <h2>His Story</h2>

                    <p>Peter Benjamin Parker is a former Midtown School of Science and Technology student who gained
                        superhuman abilities and fought crime across New York City as the superhero Spider-Man. While he
                        juggled his hero duties with the demands of his high-school life, he was recruited by Tony Stark
                        to join the Avengers Civil War, putting Spider-Man into a brief conflict with Captain America.
                        Parker was given a new suit as well as new Stark technology in exchange for his help and was
                        allowed to keep them when he returned home to continue his own hero work.</p>

                    <p>While he continued to try and prove himself as a worthy hero in the eyes of Iron Man so he could
                        join the Avengers, Parker began investigating the illicit criminal activities of Vulture, who
                        was attempting to sell his Chitauri based weapons onto the black market, with only the
                        assistance of his best friend Ned Leeds, while also trying to win his academic decathlon finals.
                        Eventually, Parker gained the affections of classmate Liz Allan, but learned her father, Adrian
                        Toomes, was Vulture. Spider-Man thwarted Vulture's robbery of a Stark Industries cargo plane, to
                        which Stark showed his respect by offering Parker an official place with the Avengers. Parker
                        turned this down in order to continue being a local hero in Queens, despite his Aunt May
                        discovering his secret identity.</p>

                    <p>Parker was pulled back into the Avengers' conflict when the Black Order had invaded Earth,
                        joining Stark as a stowaway to rescue Doctor Strange from space. Given a new Iron Spider armor,
                        Parker, Stark and Strange joined forces with the Guardians of the Galaxy, joining their attempts
                        to prevent Thanos from collecting the six Infinity Stones. But the heroes failed to defeat
                        Thanos during the Battle of Titan; resulting in half of life being wiped out; including Parker.
                        Five years later, Spider-Man was resurrected in the Blip, and rejoined the fight against Thanos,
                        ultimately watching Stark sacrifice his life to defeat the Mad Titan.</p>

                    <p>The bereaved and traumatized Parker decided to take some time off his hero duties, while also
                        being pressured by the press if he would be the next Iron Man, and seeking refuge on his school
                        trip to Europe. However, despite wanting to focus his attention on winning the attention of
                        Michelle Jones, Parker witnessed Hydro-Man's attack in Venice and was recruited by "Nick Fury"
                        to work with Mysterio to defeat the Elementals. Dubbed Night Monkey after defeating Molten Man
                        in Prague, Parker bequeathed Stark's glasses to Mysterio, only to discover that Mysterio
                        manipulated him in doing so to gain access to Stark's weaponized drones to stage more threats.
                        Recruiting Happy Hogan's help, Spider-Man traveled to London and defeated Mysterio, who died of
                        a misfired gunshot on the Tower Bridge.</p>

                    <p>Upon Parker's return to New York, doctored footage was sent to The Daily Bugle incriminating him
                        as the mastermind of the drone attacks, as well as the murderer of Mysterio, while exposing his
                        true identity to the world. While he was eventually cleared of all charges with Matt Murdock's
                        help, the resulting controversy upended his and his friends' futures, leading Parker to enlist
                        Doctor Strange to cast a memory-altering spell, wishing to make the identity of Spider-Man a
                        secret once more. However, Parker's repeated amendments mid-casting ruined the spell, resulting
                        in a multiversal rift that unleashed foes of Spider-Man from alternate universes. Although
                        intending to cure them before sending them back to avert their ill-fated deaths in their native
                        universes, Green Goblin convinced the villains to betray Parker, ultimately resulting in his
                        aunt's death. Parker then met two alternate versions of himself who helped him overcome his
                        grief and cure their enemies in a battle on the Statue of Liberty. Faced with an impossible
                        choice, Parker had Strange cast another spell to make their universe oblivious to his existence
                        in order to protect the Multiverse from collapsing, erasing himself from his friends and allies'
                        memories in his universe. Starting anew and believing himself to be dangerous to those around
                        him, Parker decided to isolate himself from everyone, including his friends and allies, in order
                        to keep them safe and resumed his duties undisturbed as an independent Spider-Man.</p>
