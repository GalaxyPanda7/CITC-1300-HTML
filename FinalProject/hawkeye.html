                    <h2>His Story</h2>
                    <p>Clinton Francis "Clint" Barton is an extremely skilled marksman, a former special agent of
                        S.H.I.E.L.D. and one of the founding members of the Avengers. Known for his use of the bow and
                        arrow as his primary weapon and his extremely keen eyesight and accuracy, which earned him the
                        codename Hawkeye, Barton had become one of the best S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, responsible for the
                        recruitment of Black Widow, with whom he developed a strong friendship. Assigned by Nick Fury
                        into watching over the Tesseract, he was brainwashed by Loki and used as his pawn in his attempt
                        to become king of Midgard. However, after the Attack on the Helicarrier, Black Widow freed him
                        from Loki's mind control, and he joined the Avengers in the Battle of New York, helping to
                        defeat Loki and the Chitauri army before returning to his work at S.H.I.E.L.D.</p>

                    <p>Hawkeye continued to work with S.H.I.E.L.D. until its collapse following the HYDRA Uprising. He
                        and the Avengers worked to bring down the remnants of HYDRA, eventually capturing Baron Strucker
                        and ending the organization's threat to the world. However, Hawkeye was pulled back into the
                        fight, since Tony Stark had inadvertently used HYDRA as well as some Chitauri technology to
                        create Ultron. As Ultron tried to destroy their world, he allied himself with Pietro and Wanda
                        Maximoff, and Barton focused much of his efforts in convincing them to change sides while
                        keeping all the Avengers safe by bringing them into his family home. During the final Battle of
                        Sokovia, Pietro saved Hawkeye's life but sacrificed his own in the process, after which Barton
                        chose to retire.</p>

                    <p>Despite living happily in retirement for a brief time, Barton was recruited by Captain America to
                        help him during his fight against the newly produced Sokovia Accords, which forced Rogers to
                        protect his friend Bucky Barnes from being arrested for a crime that he did not commit. Feeling
                        that he owed a debt to Rogers and Maximoff, Barton joined in the Battle at Leipzig-Halle
                        Airport, fighting against Iron Man's faction, which supported the Accords. Despite putting up a
                        good fight, Hawkeye and most of their team were eventually defeated and confined at the Raft
                        under an order from Thaddeus Ross, only to be freed by Rogers. Barton returned to retirement
                        and, after striking a deal with Ross, was placed under house arrest.</p>

                    <p>In the wake of the Snap, Barton lost his family and went on a grief-fuelled rampage against
                        criminals for five years as a vigilante known as Ronin. In 2023, Black Widow convinced Barton to
                        return to the Avengers in attempt to resurrect the victims of the Snap. Hawkeye joined the team
                        in enacting the Time Heist in order to obtain the Infinity Stones from alternate timelines,
                        during which he witnessed Romanoff sacrifice her life so Hawkeye could obtain the Soul Stone.
                        However, as the Avengers succeeded in their goal, they were ambushed by Thanos, and Hawkeye was
                        ordered to ensure Thanos could not get the Nano Gauntlet. Eventually, Thanos and his army were
                        defeated, as Stark sacrificed his life, allowing Barton to return home with his family while he
                        mourned Romanoff's death.</p>

                    <p>In December 2024, Barton wanted to spend Christmas with his family but was drawn into dealing
                        with the Tracksuit Mafia after Kate Bishop stole and donned the Ronin suit, bringing with it the
                        demons of Barton's past. Barton reluctantly took on Kate as his protégé as the two archers
                        navigated the increasing complication of the conspiracy. The pair had a series of clashes with
                        the Tracksuits and their leader Maya Lopez, who wanted revenge on Ronin. Barton was also hunted
                        by Yelena Belova, who believed that he had killed Romanoff, as well as helping Bishop uncover
                        her mother's involvement with Kingpin. Ultimately, Hawkeye held back fighting Belova as he
                        convinced her that her sister's sacrifice was her choice. Ending the Ronin conflict, he made it
                        home to his family, gaining a new partner in Bishop.</p>
