                    <h2>Her Story</h2>
                    <p>Natalia Alianovna "Natasha" Romanoff (Russian: Наталья Альяновна "Наташа" Романов) was one of the
                        most talented spies and assassins in the entire world and a founding member of the Avengers. As
                        a child, she was indoctrinated into the Red Room by General Dreykov, and briefly lived as the
                        surrogate daughter of Alexei Shostakov and Melina Vostokoff while they were undercover in the
                        United States of America. After the Destruction of the North Institute, she underwent extensive
                        psychological conditioning, before graduating from the Red Room as a Widow. Working as an
                        operative for the KGB, she was targeted by S.H.I.E.L.D., before given the chance to ultimately
                        defect to the organization by Clint Barton by assassinating Dreykov. Romanoff succeeded,
                        although having to use his daughter Antonia Dreykov's life as collateral damage would haunt her
                        for the rest of her life.</p>

                    <p> Having extensive mastery in martial arts and armed with her Widow's Bite, Romanoff became one of
                        S.H.I.E.L.D.'s most efficient agents, using the title given by her former organization as her
                        codename, Black Widow. During one mission, she was sent undercover into Stark Industries as
                        Natalie Rushman to watch Tony Stark due to the fear that he was dying. During this mission,
                        Romanoff assisted Stark with defeating Ivan Vanko's terrorist plots against him.</p>


                    <p>When Loki declared war on the Earth, Black Widow was recruited into the Avengers after Hawkeye
                        had just been enthralled by Loki. Romanoff assisted in recruiting Stark and Bruce Banner into
                        the team while they tracked down and attempted to capture Loki, eventually saving Barton from
                        his grasp. Once Loki's entire plan had been uncovered, Romanoff joined the team during the
                        Battle of New York and was instrumental in destroying the portal over the city which had been
                        created by the Tesseract, effectively ending the entire invasion while Loki was defeated and
                        deported back to his homeworld by his brother Thor.</p>
                    <p>In the wake of the Avengers successfully defeating Loki, Romanoff continued her work with
                        S.H.I.E.L.D., this time working with Captain America. While working together, Romanoff and
                        Rogers uncovered a conspiracy following an assassination attempt on Nick Fury, which had
                        eventually led to them discovering that HYDRA had been infiltrating their entire organization
                        since its foundation. Despite the efforts of Winter Soldier to stop them, Romanoff helped expose
                        Alexander Pierce's evil schemes to the world, which also resulted in all of her own morally
                        dubious history being revealed. As a result, Romanoff was forced into dropping off the grid
                        again and began rebuilding her cover.</p>


                    <p>Romanoff eventually rejoined the Avengers, working to bring down various HYDRA cells across the
                        world and assisting in the capture of Baron Strucker. However, before she could form a romantic
                        relationship with Banner, the rogue artificial intelligence Ultron was created by him and Stark,
                        forcing Romanoff and the rest of their team to join together and defeat him. Despite being
                        captured, Romanoff was able to inform the team of Ultron's location on Sokovia, resulting in a
                        final battle in which the Avengers had defeated Ultron once and for all, though Banner fled into
                        self-exile. Along with Captain America, Black Widow remained a member while forming the second
                        incarnation of the team.</p>

                    <p>As many of the world governments demanded the Avengers to sign the Sokovia Accords in the wake of
                        their recent battles, Romanoff agreed to their terms and signed the Accords. She later joined
                        Iron Man in a fight against Captain America due to his disagreements with the Accords and his
                        criminal activities with the Winter Soldier who Rogers was attempting to protect. As the two
                        Avengers' factions fought against each other, Romanoff betrayed Iron Man's team to assist
                        Captain America in finding the one incriminating Winter Soldier, inherently violating the
                        Sokovia Accords.</p>

                    <p>As a result, the fugitive Romanoff worked with Rick Mason to escape the government for aiding
                        Rogers. In the process, Romanoff intercepted messages from her former surrogate sister Yelena
                        Belova about the Red Room's resurgence. In possession of the Red Dust, Romanoff and Belova were
                        relentlessly pursued by Taskmaster, who worked for Dreykov, who was believed to have been
                        killed. Reuniting with her surrogate parents, they worked together to bring down the Red Room
                        once and for all. Upon learning Taskmaster was actually Antonia, who had survived all these
                        years but was mind-controlled by Dreykov, Romanoff freed her from Dreykov's enthrallment, and
                        put an end to Dreykov's plans for world domination. Romanoff soon joined Rogers in freeing the
                        incarcerated Avengers.</p>

                    <p>With the Avengers broken up, Romanoff, Rogers and Wilson went on the run for two years as
                        international fugitives, working alone to stop terrorist cells in Syria. When the threat of
                        Thanos approached Earth, Romanoff, Rogers, and Wilson protected Vision, who had the Mind Stone,
                        which Thanos was after. They later defended Wakanda from the attack, but were ultimately
                        defeated when Thanos destroyed half of all life with the Infinity Gauntlet, where Romanoff
                        emerged as one of the survivors. Romanoff was part of the Ambush on Thanos in an effort to
                        retrieve the Infinity Stones and undo the Mad Titan's snap, with no success.</p>

                    <p>Five years later, Romanoff led the Avengers alongside Captain America, now formed by Okoye,
                        Rocket, Nebula, War Machine, and Captain Marvel. With an opportunity to undo the Snap presented
                        by Ant-Man, the remaining Avengers split up into teams to retrieve all Infinity Stones from
                        several alternate timelines in the Time Heist. Sent to retrieve the Soul Stone on Vormir with
                        Barton, Romanoff, against Barton's insistence, willingly jumped off the Vormir mountains into
                        the abyss below, sacrificing herself in the process in order to obtain the Soul Stone for the
                        Avengers.</p>
